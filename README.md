# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CISTOMER_DATA

"Customer Credit Card Data Analysis" is an integral component of the UNP academic curriculum designed to equip students with hands-on experience in data analysis and business intelligence using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal of this project is to develop practical analytical skills by working with real-world data and transforming it into actionable business insights. The dataset used in this project encompasses comprehensive information about customer demographics—including age, gender, and geographical location—along with detailed data on credit card usage, transaction patterns, payment behavior, and spending habits across various product categories.

The project begins with meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the analysis. This involves identifying and handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, correcting inconsistencies, and applying standard formats. After preparing the data, Excel’s built-in Business Intelligence tools such as pivot tables, pivot charts, conditional formatting, slicers, filters, and data validation features are employed to delve deep into the data. These tools facilitate the exploration of key metrics such as monthly and yearly spending trends, average transaction frequency, cash advance usage, credit limit utilization, payment-to-minimum due ratios, and customer tenure. By completing this project, students gain a deep understanding of how to leverage Excel for business intelligence purposes and how to translate raw data into meaningful narratives. The final outcome is a professionally designed Excel dashboard that serves as a powerful decision-support tool, enabling stakeholders to make informed choices backed by clear, visual evidence derived from the data.
